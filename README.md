# Data Structures
Undergraduate course.

## Description
--
This course investigates abstract data types (ADTs), recursion, algorithms for searching and sorting, and basic algorithm analysis. ADTs to be covered include lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, trees, sets, and dictionaries. The emphasis is on the trade-offs associated with implementing alternative data structures for these ADTs. This course will be taught in a language agnostic fashion. Students may choose to develop their work in C, C++, or Python.
